I am replacing the upload (useful as a learning experience) with a new approach
that handles both the upload and the import of the CSV, per ChatGPT.

For this 'uploader' app, I used the answer Demo by suhailvs, as found at:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5871730/how-to-upload-a-file-in-django

It is quite stand-alone, not sure how to interface this with the 'vds' app, but this would actually be a great use case to gain experience for the future.
